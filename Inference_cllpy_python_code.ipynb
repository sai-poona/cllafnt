Write a response which converts the Java implementation to an implementation in Python. Problem Context: The code aims to sort an array A such that all even integers are positioned at even indices and all odd integers are placed at odd indices in Java as shown below. The method iterates through the array with a step size of 2, focusing on even indices. If an odd integer is encountered at an even index, it searches for the next even index containing an even integer. Once found, it swaps the odd integer at the current even index with the even integer at the found even index. This process continues until all even integers are at even indices and all odd integers are at odd indices. Finally, it returns the sorted array A. \\nCode in Java: \\n```import java.util.HashSet;\\n\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int numUniqueEmails(String[] emails) {\\n        HashSet<String> emailSet = new HashSet<>();\\n        for (String email: emails) {\\n            String firstSplit[] = email.split(\"\"@\"\");\\n            String secondSplit[] = firstSplit[0].replaceAll(\"\".\"\", \"\"\"\").split(\"\"[+]\"\");\\n            emailSet.add(secondSplit[0] + firstSplit[1]);\\n        }     \\n        return emailSet.size();\\n    }\\n}```\\n \"\\n\\n### Response:\\n'"

      "Solution Context: The Python code below demonstrates how to sort an array of emails by converting each email address into a unique key. It iterates through the array of emails, splitting each email address into two parts: the local part and the domain part. The local part is then processed to remove any periods and replace any plus signs with empty strings. The resulting key is then combined with the domain part and added to a set. Finally, the number of unique keys in the set is returned. This process ensures that all emails with the same local part and domain are grouped together, resulting in a sorted array of emails. \n",
