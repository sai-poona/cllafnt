Since the new nodes are right after their corresponding originals, we can easily set the `random` pointers for the new nodes based on the `random` pointers of the original nodes.\n3. Separate the interleaved list into two separate lists - the original list and the copied list.\n\nThis algorithm creates a deep copy of the linked list with random pointers without using any extra space or data structures other than the nodes themselves. The running time complexity is O(n) as we do three separate O(n) passes through the linked list.\n\n### Code\n```scala\nclass Node(var _value: Int) {\n  var value: Int = _value\n  var next: Node = null\n  var random: Node = null\n}\n\nobject Solution {\n    def copyRandomList(head: Node): Node = {\n        if (head == null) return null\n        \n        var curr = head\n        while (curr != null) {\n            val temp = new Node(curr.value)\n            temp.next = curr.next\n            curr.next = temp\n            curr = curr.next.next\n        }\n\n        curr = head\n        while (curr != null) {\n            if (curr.random != null) {\n                curr.next.random = curr.random.next\n            }\n            curr = curr.next.next\n        }\n\n        var orig = head\n        var copy = head.next\n        val copyHead = copy\n\n        while (orig != null && copy != null) {\n            orig.next = copy.next\n            orig = orig.next\n            if (orig != null) {\n                copy.next = orig.next\n                copy = copy.next\n            }\n        }\n\n        copyHead\n    }\n}\n```"}

This mapping will later be used to determine if a number in `arr` is in the target sequence and its relative order. It then initializes an empty list called `lis` (Longest Increasing Subsequence) and iterates through `arr`.\n\nFor each number `num` in `arr`, if it's also in the target, we check if that number can be appended to the end of `lis`. If not, it replaces the first number in `lis` that is greater than or equal to it to maintain the sorted order. This is done using `lowerBound` (C++, JavaScript) or `bisect_left` (Python) or `Arrays.binarySearch` (Java) functions - all of which perform binary search to find the position at which the new number should be inserted.\n\nFinally, the algorithm returns the difference between the lengths of the target sequence and `lis`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to make `target` a subsequence of `arr`.\n\n### Pseudocode:\n```\nFUNCTION min_operations(target: STRING, arr: STRING) RETURNS INTEGER\n    index_map \u2190 empty DICTIONARY\n    FOR i \u2190 1 to LENGTH(target) DO\n        index_map[target[i]] \u2190 i\n    \n    lis \u2190 empty LIST\n    FOR i \u2190 1 to LENGTH(arr) DO\n        num \u2190 arr[i]\n        IF num IN index_map THEN\n            pos \u2190 BINARY_SEARCH(lis, index_map[num])\n            IF pos = LENGTH(lis) THEN\n                APPEND index_map[num] TO lis\n            ELSE\n                lis[pos] \u2190 index_map[num]\n    \n    RETURN LENGTH(target) - LENGTH(lis)\nEND FUNCTION\n```\n\n### Code\n```julia\nfunction is_pangram(sentence::AbstractString)::Bool\n    alphabet = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    for letter in alphabet\n        if letter \u2209 sentence\n            return false\n        end\n    end\n    return true\nend\n```"}
{"system_prompt":"You are a helpful AI assistant","question":"Please explain the following problem in detail and provide code in Object Pascal:\nOn a **single-threaded** CPU, we execute a program containing `n` functions. Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.\n\nFunction calls are **stored in a [call stack](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Call_stack)**: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is **the current function being executed**. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n\nYou are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `\"{function_id}:{ \"start \" | \"end \"}:{timestamp} \"`. For example, `\"0:start:3 \"` means a function call with function ID `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`, and `\"1:end:2 \"` means a function call with function ID `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called **multiple times, possibly recursively**.\n\nA function's **exclusive time** is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the **exclusive time** is `2 + 1 = 3`.\n\nReturn _the **exclusive time** of each function in an array, where the value at the_ `ith` _index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID_ `i`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 2, logs = \\[ \"0:start:0 \", \"1:start:2 \", \"1:end:5 \", \"0:end:6 \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[3,4\\]\n**Explanation:**\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 1, logs = \\[ \"0:start:0 \", \"0:start:2 \", \"0:end:5 \", \"0:start:6 \", \"0:end:6 \", \"0:end:7 \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[8\\]\n**Explanation:**\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\nFunction 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 2, logs = \\[ \"0:start:0 \", \"0:start:2 \", \"0:end:5 \", \"1:start:6 \", \"1:end:6 \", \"0:end:7 \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[7,1\\]\n**Explanation:**\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`\n*   `1 <= logs.length <= 500`\n*   `0 <= function_id < n`\n*   `0 <= timestamp <= 109`\n*   No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.\n*   No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.\n*   Each function has an `\"end \"` log for each `\"start \"` log.","response":"### Explanation\n The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the active function calls. We iterate through the logs and parse each log to obtain the `id`, `type`, and `timestamp`. \n\nIf the current log type is \"start\", we check if the stack is not empty, and if so, we update the result entry for the function at the top of the stack by adding the time elapsed since the previous timestamp, `time - prev_time`. Then we push the new function's ID onto the stack and update the `prev_time` to the current `time`.\n\nIf the current log type is \"end\", we update the result entry for the function at the top of the stack by adding the time elapsed plus one, `time - prev_time + 1`.
